				Rammstein is a <em>German Neue Deutsche Härte</em> band formed in Berlin in 1994. The band's lineup—consisting of lead vocalist Till Lindemann, lead guitarist Richard Kruspe, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, bassist Oliver Riedel, drummer Christoph Schneider, and keyboardist Christian "Flake" Lorenz—has remained unchanged throughout their history, along with their approach to songwriting, which consists of Lindemann writing and singing the lyrics over instrumental pieces the rest of the band has completed beforehand. Prior to their formation, some members were associated with the punk rock acts Feeling B and First Arsch.

				Rammstein is considered to be a hard rock and gothic metal, as well as nu metal, alternative metal, symphonic metal, progressive metal, and "techno-metal".
				Rammstein was traditionally inspired by bands such as the Slovenian group <em>Laibach</em>, known for its provocative songs, often citing political symbols of the far-right and whose music style also combines different genres, or the German rock band Oomph! However, the band members don't see a real connection to <em>Laibach</em> – apart from the similarity in vocal style which <em>Flake Lorenz</em> admitted in a Viva interview from 1997. In the same interview Richard Kruspe said: "For me, Laibach is a very, very intellectual story. Rammstein is much more emotional for me – in the beginning. And I can't do anything with that intellect that Laibach uses."
				Unlike many bands from Berlin in the early 1990s, Rammstein didn't want to imitate American or English bands. Flake Lorenz said in an interview: "We found the style by knowing exactly what we didn't want. And we just didn't want to do American funky music or punk or anything we can't do. We realized that we can only do this music that we also play. And it's just very simple, dull, monotone."
